                <p>The Persian cat (Persian: گربه پارسی, romanized: Gorbe'-ye Pârsi) is a long-haired breed of cat
                    characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in
                    English-speaking countries. The first documented ancestors of Persian cats were imported into Italy
                    from
                    Persia around 1620.</p>

                    contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
